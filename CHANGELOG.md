## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-01

A deliberate compatibility break. It exists to move the entire dependency stack
to current releases in one step, and it was validated end to end on real
hardware — a Raspberry Pi 5 running a freshly built image with a B&K Precision
1902B attached.

**Upgrading from 1.x? Read [docs/BREAKING_CHANGES_2.0.md](docs/BREAKING_CHANGES_2.0.md) first.**

### 💥 Breaking

- **Python 3.12 is now the minimum** (was 3.11; `setup.py` still claimed 3.8).
  Forced by numpy 2.5 and scipy 1.18, which both require it. The server is
  unaffected in practice — it runs in Docker on `python:3.13-slim`. The desktop
  client runs natively and does need 3.12+.
- **Every user is logged out on upgrade.** Access tokens are now bound to a
  server-side session, which is what makes logout and password change able to
  revoke them. Tokens issued by 1.x carry no `session_id` and are refused.
- **SSH deployment no longer accepts `ssh-rsa` (RSA/SHA-1) host keys.** paramiko
  5.0.0 removes them, fixing PYSEC-2026-2858. A device offering only an
  `ssh-rsa` host key can no longer be deployed to; regenerate its host keys with
  `sudo ssh-keygen -A`. Current Raspberry Pi OS is unaffected.
- **The WebSocket port is retired.** `/ws` has always been a route on the API
  server; `LABLINK_WS_PORT` configured a port nothing ever bound. It is now
  accepted and ignored so an existing `.env` does not break startup.
- **Pi images are built on Debian Trixie** (13) instead of Bookworm (12).

### ✨ Added

- Live hardware acceptance suite (`tests/hardware/test_live_pi.py`) — 29 tests
  covering deployment, SSH, the auth lifecycle, equipment discovery and
  readings, WebSocket auth and file-descriptor stability. Skipped unless
  configured, so CI is unaffected.
- B&K Precision auto-detection: a model registry covering 30 families, generic
  SCPI drivers, and a serial probe that finds instruments VISA cannot enumerate
  (USB-CDC models, and legacy supplies that answer no `*IDN?`).
- `scripts/diagnose_bk_discovery.py`, a layer-by-layer discovery diagnostic that
  reports which stage dropped an instrument.
- Pi images can be built from any git branch (`LABLINK_BRANCH`) and from either
  Raspberry Pi OS Lite or Full (`PI_OS_VARIANT`), both exposed in the client's
  image-builder wizard.
- Persistent failed-login tracking, so account lockout survives a restart.
- OAuth2 `state` is now verified and single-use, closing a login-CSRF hole.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Device discovery returned zero devices on any established install.** A
  function-local `datetime` import in `lifespan()` turned a nested discovery
  callback's reference into an unbound closure, so every scan raised.
- **MFA backup codes could never be verified.** Hashing kept the code as
  generated while verification stripped the hyphen and upper-cased it, so the
  two never matched and account recovery was impossible. Codes stored before
  this release remain unusable and must be regenerated.
- **Every backup failed.** `create_backup()` verified the backup before
  registering it, so verification always raised "Backup not found" — and
  verification is on by default. Backup IDs could also collide within the same
  second, silently overwriting metadata.
- **Pi images shipped a hardcoded application admin password.** The build-time
  `LABLINK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` never reached the first-boot script, which fell back
  to a built-in default and echoed it to the system journal.
- **A file-descriptor leak in `DatabaseManager`** — 13 methods closed their
  connection only on success. Measured at 200 leaked descriptors across 200
  failing calls.
- **Blocking SQLite calls stalled the event loop** across four subsystems.
- **The GUI froze during live monitoring.** Timer-driven polling called the
  synchronous HTTP client directly on the Qt thread.
- **SSH host-key acceptance was unreachable on non-standard ports**, so a host
  could never be trusted through the deploy wizard.
- **`server/.env` was tracked in git and baked into the server image**, where it
  overrode host configuration invisibly.
- The firmware update endpoint returned 500; a bare ASRL port listing outranked
  a real instrument identification; and the JWT secret was regenerated on every
  restart when unset, invalidating all tokens.

### 📝 Changed

- Every dependency pinned to a current release: numpy 2.5.2, pandas 3.0.5,
  scipy 1.18.1, paramiko 5.0.0, websockets 17.1, bcrypt 5.0.0, psutil 7.2.2,
  PyQt6 6.11.0, pytest 9.1.1, pyvisa 1.16.2, FastAPI 0.141.1. `pip-audit`
  reports no known vulnerabilities across the full stack.
- Pi images are ~35% faster to burn: a flat 2GB of padding that first-boot
  filesystem growth immediately superseded is now 256MB.
- CI covers Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- The test suite went from ~95 failures and a run that hung indefinitely to
  **1127 passing**. Many tests had drifted out of sync with the code; others
  silently skipped themselves for features that were implemented, which is how
  several of the bugs above survived.

### 🔒 Security

- Access tokens are revocable; logout, password change and admin reset take
  effect immediately rather than leaving a token valid for up to 7 days.
- OAuth2 `state` verification, persistent lockout, and a JWT secret that
  survives restarts.
- `sudo` removed from the server runtime image; environment files can no longer
  be baked into images.

  - "Expected if this is an SSH Docker deployment" for missing first-boot log
  - "Expected if this is an SSH deployment" for first-boot setup not complete

  - Removed verbose systemctl output window
  - Added compact service status indicator below deployment log
  - Reduced wizard height (880px → 600px) for cleaner interface
