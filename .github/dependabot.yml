# Notes:
# - Security updates are NEVER grouped - they always create separate PRs
# - Groups combine multiple dependency updates into a single PR
# - Major version updates are kept separate for careful review
# - open-pull-requests-limit reduced to prevent PR spam
# - Weekly schedule on Mondays keeps updates manageable
